# Software Engineer 🧠⚡


I build software with a focus on **performance, correctness, and system design**.

I’ve worked on **large-scale, production systems** and prefer building things that hold up under real-world constraints.

My work spans backend services, frontend interfaces, and robust architecture, ensuring code is predictable and maintainable.

Some projects are public; others are private.

🐈‍⬛ The cat handles code reviews. I handle the rest.

## 🚀 What I Focus On


- Writing **efficient, predictable code**
- Understanding systems **below the abstraction**
- Designing **scalable, well-reasoned system architectures**
- Building software that holds up under **real-world constraints**
- Choosing the right tool — not the fashionable one
